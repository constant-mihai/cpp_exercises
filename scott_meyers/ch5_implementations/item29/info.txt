Strive for exeption saftey code.
Exception-safe functions leak no resources and allow no data structures to become corrupted, 
even when exceptions are thrown. 
Such functions offer the basic, 
strong, or nothrow guarantees.

The strong guarantee can often 
be implemented via copy-and-swap,
 but the strong guarantee is not 
practical for all functions.

A function can usually offer a 
guarantee no stronger than the
weakest guarantee of the functions it calls.
