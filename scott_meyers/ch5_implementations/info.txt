Minimize casting.

The rules of C++ are designed to guarantee that type errors are impossible. 
In theory, if your program compiles cleanly, it's not trying to perform any 
unsafe or nonsensical operations on any objects. 
This is a valuable guarantee. You don't want to forgo it lightly.

Unfortunately, casts subvert the type system. 
That can lead to all kinds of trouble, some easy to recognize, some extraordinarily subtle. 
If you're coming to C++ from C, Java, or C#, take note,
because casting in those languages is more necessary and less dangerous than in C++.

But C++ is not C. It's not Java. It's not C#. 
In this language, casting is a feature you want to approach with great respect.
